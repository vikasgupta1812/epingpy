## Why start this? ##
The websites of the company I work for run on a ISS/Tomcat server. Sometimes they just crash. And not in a good way. There is absolutely no HTML output, not even a 404 error. But the server itself is still pingable. This occurs randomly throughout the day. To check how often, and also to check during evenings and weekend, I decided to try and make something useful.

2010/2/7:

After passing several logfile excerpts from the ePing.py that
I installed at work, the application that runs our websites has been reworked
by the company who created that application. The websites run fine now most of
the time. So making this little program has already proved it's purpose, even if nobody else uses it... :)

However I do have lost a playground of extreme situations. Ah well, guess the
program should be tailored for normal situations anyway.

## Features ##
  * Usefull when only ping-check is not enough
  * e-mail notification
  * 1 configuration file, no configuration in code is necessary. Altough the exact words in e-mail and log notification can not be adjusted without changing the code

## Support ##
Support ePing.py by giving feedback. If something can be done better, bugs, missing features, please let me know.

Of course the source code is available. If you use it and make changes or fixes, please let me know.

It is also possible to donate with PayPal.
